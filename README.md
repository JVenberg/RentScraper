# Rent Scraper

This is a personal project that scrapes my apartment's rent page, so I can use data to
argue against rent increases. Could possibly work for other apartments that
use RealPage property management software.

If you are a software engineer at RealPage, please don't change the API. Haven't
you done enough?
